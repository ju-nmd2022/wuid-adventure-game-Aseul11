            <h2>ABOUT DOCTOR WHO</h2>
            <p>Doctor Who is a British television series. It centres on a time traveller called "the Doctor", coming from a race of beings known as Time Lords. He travels through time and space with his companions in a time machine called the TARDIS. This ship — which looks like a small, London police box on the outside — has nearly infinite dimensions on the inside.</p>
