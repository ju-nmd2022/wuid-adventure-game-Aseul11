        <h2>The story befind the game</h2>
       <p>You were travelling with The Doctor and his companions on a planet called Alfava Metraxis, when you met a wheeping angels. These creatures can displace their victims backwards in time with a single touch, which exactly happened with The Doctor. You have no idea where and in what time he can be, but you should save him with a help of his other companions. </p>
